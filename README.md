## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework:** [React](https://react.dev/) (with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) App Router)
- **Design System:** Atomic pattern for modular, reusable components; UI by [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for responsive and utility-first styling
- **State Management:** React hooks, Context API for local/global state
- **Routing:** File-based, with protected routes for authenticated areas

**Directory Structure:**
```
src/app/
├── page.tsx              # Landing page entry
├── login/                # Login and registration
├── dashboard/            # User dashboard & profile
├── upload/               # Style photo upload
├── quiz/                 # Style preference quiz
├── chat/                 # AI chat interface
├── recommendations/      # Personalized product listings
└── cart/                 # Shopping cart and checkout
```

**Components:**
```

├── assistant/
│   ├── LoginForm.tsx
│   ├── DashboardNav.tsx
│   ├── ImageUploader.tsx
│   ├── StyleQuiz.tsx
│   ├── ChatAssistant.tsx

└── ui/                   # Shadcn UI components
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Atomic Design:** UI built from smallest atoms (buttons, inputs) to complex organisms (chat, quizzes).
- **Reusability:** All visual and logic components are modular.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes applied throughout.
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive layouts, touch-friendly controls, optimized images.

---

### Backend Architecture

- **API Design:** RESTful, stateless endpoints with clear request/response contracts.
- **Framework:** Next.js API routes (Node.js), scalable to serverless/serverful deployments.
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, session management.
- **Data Validation:** Input checked both client-side and server-side.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error middleware returns standardized, type-safe errors.
- **Extensibility:** Modular routes for easy addition of new features.

**API Structure:**
```
src/app/api/
├── auth/
│   └── route.ts           # Registration, login, logout, user profile
├── recommendations/
│   └── route.ts           # AI-driven product recommendations
├── chat/
│   └── route.ts           # Conversational AI endpoints
└── cart/
    └── route.ts           # Cart CRUD operations, price/coupon logic
```

**Data Flow:**
- **Frontend** sends requests (e.g., product quiz, style upload, add to cart)
- **API** validates, authenticates, processes, and responds with JSON
- **Database** (e.g., PlanetScale, Supabase) stores user, product, and session data
- **External Integrations:** Calls to fashion APIs, coupon scrapers, and AI model endpoints as needed

---

## Core Modules & Implementation

### Authentication System

- **Registration/Login:** Users register/log in with email & password; passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- **JWT Sessions:** Short-lived tokens issued on login; tokens verified for all protected endpoints.
- **Session Management:** Refresh tokens for seamless experience; session expiration triggers re-auth.
- **Route Protection:** Middleware checks tokens for private pages (dashboard, cart, etc.).
- **Security:** HTTPS enforced, rate limiting, brute-force mitigation.

---

### AI & ML Features

#### 1. Chat Assistant

- **NLP Engine:** Integrates with LLMs (e.g., GPT, open-source models) fine-tuned for fashion queries.
- **Context Handling:** Maintains multi-turn conversations and remembers preferences.
- **Fashion Domain Knowledge:** Trained on large datasets of trends, styles, and e-commerce interactions.
- **Real-Time:** WebSocket or streaming API for smooth, conversational feel.

#### 2. Style Analysis

- **Image Upload:** Users upload clothing/fit photos.
- **Feature Extraction:** ML models analyze color palette, style (casual, formal, etc.), patterns, and clothing type.
- **Classification:** Suggests matching items, color pairings, and recommendations tailored to user’s style.
- **Privacy:** Images processed securely; no persistent storage unless user consents.

#### 3. Recommendation Engine

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Learns from behaviors of users with similar tastes.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Matches products using style tags, color, and metadata from user uploads/quiz.
- **Preference Learning:** Continuously improves as the user interacts (likes, skips, purchases).
- **Dynamic Scoring:** Re-ranks recommendations based on context (season, occasion, cart contents).

---

### Shopping Cart Optimization

#### 1. Price Comparison

- **Multi-Platform Scraping:** Real-time fetch from popular e-commerce APIs/websites.
- **Deal Identification:** Highlights best prices, alternative marketplaces, and time-limited offers.
- **Update Frequency:** Prices updated in real-time as items are added or as checkout approaches.

#### 2. Smart Bundling

- **Bundle Recognition:** Detects offers like “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” or combo discounts.
- **Cross-Platform Optimization:** Suggests splits across different platforms for maximum savings.
- **Savings Calculator:** Shows user exact amount saved by following suggestions.

#### 3. Coupon Integration

- **Auto-Testing:** Applies valid coupons automatically and tests all combinations.
- **Best Combination:** Selects coupon stack yielding highest discount.
- **Transparency:** Displays all applied discounts and potential savings.

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend

- **Code Splitting:** Loads only necessary JS for each route.
- **Lazy Loading:** Images, components, and data fetches load on-demand.
- **Image Optimization:** Uses Next.js/Image or similar for responsive, CDN-hosted images.
- **Browser/Service Worker Caching:** Reduces repeat requests and speeds up navigation.

### Backend

- **Request Caching:** Caches results for expensive operations (e.g., recommendations).
- **DB Indexing & Query Optimization:** Ensures fast read/write, especially on user/product tables.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents API abuse and maintains consistent performance.

---

## Security Measures

### Authentication

- **HTTPS Only:** All data encrypted in transit.
- **JWT Security:** Tokens signed with strong secrets, short lifespans.
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with salting and iteration.
- **Rate Limiting:** IP/user-based request throttling.

### Data Protection

- **Input Sanitization:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other code injection attacks.
- **XSS Prevention:** Escapes outputs, uses secure React practices.
- **CSRF Protection:** Anti-CSRF tokens on sensitive operations.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data encrypted at rest (e.g., user details, payment info).

### API Security

- **Request Validation:** Strict type checks, schema validation.
- **Error Handling:** Avoids information leaks in error messages.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for sensitive endpoints.
- **API Key Management:** For integrations with third-party services.
